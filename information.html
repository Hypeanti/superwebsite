        <li>Our second event will be an indie game convention. This event will give an opportunity to any
            up and coming game developers to showcase their projects and what they have been working on.
            The idea of this event is to help provide exposure to smaller developers and to potentially
            give them the boost they need to help their game take off. We aim to provide the best experience
            to all attending and to those showcasing their games.</li>
            <li>As well we hope this can be an opportunity for game developers to have their games tested 
                and played by others so they can get feedback on how their game plays.</li>
        <li>The entire time during this event, there will be a "support stand" open throughout the whole 
            time the event is on. The idea of this support stand is to provide help or guidance to any 
            new developers or anyone at all who may need assistance with anything game development related.</li>
