        <li>Our first event is a gaming tournament. It features a plethora of popular games ranging from
        Fornite to League of Legends. People of all skill levels are welcome to join and just have
        a bit of fun in a friendly competitive environment.</li>
        <li>There will be resources like controllers and headphones available for free use at the venue 
            but it is recommended to bring your own. As well as this, there will be food and drink stands 
            scattered across the venue where you can purchase only the finest quality refreshments to fuel your 
            gaming endeavours.</li>

        <li>Our second event will be an indie game convention. This event will give an opportunity to any
            up and coming game developers to showcase their projects and what they have been working on.
            The idea of this event is to help provide exposure to smaller developers and to potentially
            give them the boost they need to help their game take off. We aim to provide the best experience
            to all attending and to those showcasing their games.</li>
            <li>As well we hope this can be an opportunity for game developers to have their games tested 
                and played by others so they can get feedback on how their game plays.</li>
        <li>The entire time during this event, there will be a "support stand" open throughout the whole 
            time the event is on. The idea of this support stand is to provide help or guidance to any 
            new developers or anyone at all who may need assistance with anything game development related.</li>

    <ul>
        <div class="Description1">
        <li>Our third event will be a cosplay convention. This is a fun and welcoming event where people 
            can cosplay as their favourite characters and show off their creativity and artistic talent. 
            There is no limit to what you can cosplay as so we encourage you to bring your BEST cosplay 
            and show off your hard work and passion.</li>
        <li>During this event there will be a competition on the "best cosplay" which will be decided via 
            public vote by everyone attending the event. There, of course, will be a lovely mystery prize 
            for the best rated cosplay.</li>
            <li>As well, there will be a stand open at all times that can do repairs to people's cosplay 
                which the cost of this has been covered by the event so there is no worry of price.</li>

    <ul>
        <div class="Description1">
        <li>Our final event as of current will be a tabletop game event. This event aims to me more of a relaxed 
            thing where people can just hang out and play together. There will be tabletop games like Catan, Risk, 
            DnD, Magic the Gathering, Pokemon and many more. This will be a bit of a lesser event compared to some of ours 
            but it should be just as good as any of our previous events.</li>
        <li>There will be many games available at the venue but it is highly recommended to bring your own as if there 
            is a big turnout, there may not be games available for everyone to play at once. So please don't be 
            afraid to bring in your favourite game and engage with others as this is what the event is all about.</li>
